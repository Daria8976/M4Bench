No difference.\n- This option suggests that there is no difference between the part pairs in the two images.\n- However, as analyzed in options A, B, and C, there is a difference in the locations of the part pairs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as it correctly identifies that the part pairs in the two images are semantic aligned but different in location.\n\nThe correct answer is: C",
